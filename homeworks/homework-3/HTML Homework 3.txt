Homework 3 
1. Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they different? 
Flexbox is a 1 dimensional, meaning you can only use it vertically or horizontally. CSS grid is a 2 dimensional, meaning you can create both rows and columns at the same time. They are alike in that they can both create responsive layouts for HTML.


2. What’s responsive design in web development and how do we implement it?


Responsive design allows the web page to shift size relative to the screen size. For example, its how the Fordham website works on my computer, my ipad, and my phone despite the different dimensions of screens. You can implement it through the use of flex boxes and grids.


3. Create a HTML file with a flex container and three flex items. Give the flex items a color and width/height of 100px. For screens <500px wide have the items flow vertically and >= 500px flow horizontally. 


4. Create a form with bootstrap, should have a few input elements, labels, and a submit button.
