1. What are relationships in SQL? Joins? 
Relationships in SQL are established associations between two or more tables. They are based on a common field in both tables. Joins are how we implement relationships. 


2. How do joins and relationships interact? 
There are different types of joins that determine the results that will be printed. A left join shows all the information from the left table, and the information that matches from the right table. An inner join shows only the overlapping data from the two tables. 


3. What’s a PDO? a DSN?
A PDO is a built-in class that comes packaged with PHP to make it easy to interact with databases.  A DSN is a data source name that contains information about our connection to the database, such as passwords. 


4. What are prepared statements? Why do we need them? 
Prepared statement is parameterized and reusable SQL query which forces the devloper to write the SQL command and the user-provided data separately. It is to prevent against hacks. 


5. What does an .env file do? 
A .env file contains environment variables. It typically stores passwords and other sensitive information.
